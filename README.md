# binance_brokarage_api_client

connect to binance brokarage api with a simple html client

The API connection is made from the browser (client)

Binance does not allow API connections from browsers (CORS Header Errors), thats why the electron framework is used

### install electron

npm install electron --save

### start application

npm start
